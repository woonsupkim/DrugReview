0,"I am a fit 63 year old male who was surprised to learn he had low bone density. I took 4 injections of Prolia without side effects from 2014 to 2016 on recommendation of an endocrinologist. My bone density appeared to have improved slightly. I had a follow up appointment with my endocrinologist in May 2017 and he was quite concerned, having recently read reports of spontaneous spinal fractures and rapid reversal of bone density gains after ceasing to use Prolia. So we finally discussed where my Prolia use was going long term and he was vague - 10 years  of Prolia and then transition to bisphosphonates. Ten years on a drug that hadn't been tested that long! I realized I was a guinea pig taking a drug with an alarming and growing list of side effects for uncertain benefit (after all, people have fractured femurs as a result of taking this drug - one of the strongest bones in the body). Time to abandon this train before it ran off the rails or crashed. I will take no more Prolia. Before you take Prolia have a careful chat to your physician about your long term plans - once on this drug, you can't stop without rapid reversal of bone density gain - you become a slave to it - so you may want consider whether there is any point in starting?",0.87346125,0.014791279,0.005041794,0.0072805667,0.0031952278,0.005019809,0.005157012,0.004917573,0.0114999665,0.002084134,0.0034286182

Not sure if it is related, will have stress test this week.  Have noticed a difference in my teeth, going to the dentist soon to see if there is a change in strength and spacing.

2,"At the age of 62, I discovered I had severe osteoporosis in the spine, and after trying oral bisphosphonates (terrible reaction!) requested denusomab. Three injections in, and helped by supplementary calcium and vitamin D, my bone density has improved by 5%. I am cautiously delighted. No noticeable side effects so far.

9,"This drug has ruined my mother's daily life. Prior to getting this shot she was an active and fairly healthy 75 year old women.  She is miserable now, having developed skin lesions all over her body that constantly itch like crazy! She has tried everything that her doctor has told her to do. She saw a dermatologist who told her to take a bleach bath, has had steroid cream among other creams and pills to ""help"",  all of which have done nothing for this problem that arose after having this shot.  She is miserable and has lost interest in daily activities. Please read the reviews and consider the side effects even if they are rare or unlikely side effects.

10,"Don't take this medication if you live alone.  Thank God I have a supportive husband at my side since the side effects of Prolia started kicking in 10 days after the second injection.  (By the way, the physician who talked me into taking it has quit the practice and gone into concierge medicine.)  I've gone from being a healthy 67-year-old to a partial cripple in the last 3-1/2 months.  Almost every day there's a new place that hurts.  I have widespread bone, joint and muscle pain.  Getting in and out of a car is difficult.  Yesterday, my husband had to drive me to a doctor's appointment because my knees were too stiff to work the pedals.  Having very few button-down-the front blouses is a wardrobe negative;  pulling a shirt or nightgown over my head is agony. Reaching a high shelf in the kitchen is impossible, nor can I lift a turkey for Thanksgiving.  I'm starting to use handicapped stalls in public restrooms.  All that being said, I'm still able to fast-walk five laps at the mall in the afternoons, although it hurts.  Riding in a car more than a few minutes makes me really stiff.  My collar bones hurt so much that they were x-rayed.  No bone cancer,ELMH thank God.  Next month I get to see a rheumatologist.  By the way, acupuncture didn't work for me.

12,"Further update. It is now a year since my first Prolia injection. I will be having my third injection because my bone density score has gone from -2.7 last year to -2.1 now which means I no longer have osteoporosis, it has been reduced to osteopenia.  Yes I do get aches and pains but I really cannot say that is due to the Prolia, more like general aging of my joints.  I am happy with the results.

15,"I thought I was going crazy...but reading these reviews have eased my mind.  Two weeks after my injection EVERY BONE AND JOINT in my body is extremely PAINFUL.  This is my third shot, first one was not so bad, 6 months later for second shot, the severe pain started.  I put the third round for an extra few months because I didn't want to ruin my summer.  Now, after the 3rd dose I can barely move and get through the day.  I cant exercise or get to the gym, just getting out of bed and getting through my day as a teacher is almost impossible.

18,My family is trying to weigh the positive and negative effects of taking this medication.  I cannot understand why there are no concrete facts (i.e. bone density results) to essentially stand for the positive side of taking this medication.  Therefore there is no evidence at all that points to this medication working to improve osteoporosis.  The best review is that there were no side effects.  Where are the people who took the full doe of this medication?
