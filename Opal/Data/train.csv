this treatment is awsome.  I love drugs.,effectiveness
After taking this drug for approx. 21 days I started spotting and bleeding.  I'm bloated and feel tired.  So far I'm not impressed and not a happy camper at all.  There has to be another solution or medication other than this particular medication.,side effect
I have taken this drug for almost 7 years without any side effects. I have recommended Lopreeza to other women with confidence.  ,side effect
since I have a hard time swallowing this hs worked for me,ease of use
I have severe pain in my hand and muscle joints after taking this medicine!,side effect
"Food dyes and talc...large pill for a newly removed thyroid throat! So I have been dissolving them in a bit of hot water, add a little fruit juice and drink it! HAVE A BAD COUGH SINCE STARTING THIS CALCIUM. COULD IT BE AN ALLERGIC REACTION?",side effect
"I have taken it for 6 months and it did not increase nor decrease. But I got a persistent cough. When I interrupted for few days, cough disapeared. Once I re-started taking the medication I got cough again.",side effect
"I am 64 years old, and am trying to avoid loss of bone.  My Doctor suggested I take calcium plus D.  OS-CAL ultra has always worked very well.  For a few months I could not find OS-CAL anywhere on pharmacy shelves. When I started taking the 600 plus D I was elated.  Now 2 weeks later I am having a reaction to the coating on the tablets.  I have been allergic to Reds and Yellow dyes for ages (20 years), the tablets appear gray in color, but upon reading the back label I discovered red 40 lake along with blue 2 lake.  My someone please contace GlazoSmithKline and ask IF they even make a all white tablet or send me the info. and I will call them.

This drug is awesome.  I love drugs.,effectiveness
"Doctor wants to put me on bovina
another says i do not need the medication. I am 93 years old ,play 18 holes of golf three days a week. Iam in very good health. The former dr. has the bone densit machine in his office",effectiveness
"I have been on menostar for three years and love it...my bone density has improved, all my menopausal symptoms have disappeared, and i lost ten pounds.  ",effectiveness
"My first month on Minivelle patch was good. No problems to report. However, during the second month the patch left itchy, red circular area.  Drug rep suggested waving patch around for 30 seconds prior to putting it on skin to evaporate alcohol.  I tried but my allergic reaction to it grew worse. I have to try something else.  Bummer!",side effect
"Pharmacist switched from my Vivelle dot to this last month and it was terrible!! Headaches, fatigue and it actually burned a circle on my skin where patch was located!!! BEWARE, I have gone back to Vivelle Dot and will never use minivelle again. Companies should not be able to arbitrarily switch like this!",side effect
"Am I the only one out there that is hyper-sensitive to hormone replacement? This is the third time I have tried a ""bio-identical"" estrogen. Started with cream about 10 yrs ago, couldn't hack that. Couple years ago my Dr. put me on vaginal estradiol. Worked great in the sex dept. since menopause made sex so painful. After a while on that, had to stop due to shortness of breath, sleep issues, jitters. Plus my estrogen level sky-rocked to 900! Dr. just put me on Miniville 0.0375 one week ago. Today I am feeling the shortness of breath, jittery and fatique. Been using topical progesterone for years and had to back off of that. Have worsening osteopenia in hip and osteoporisis in lower spine. Brief stint with Prometrium helped the bone loss, but side effects were too much. Think part of the bone problem may stem from years of acid reflux med, Prevacid. I exercise, take calcium, D3, magnesium, K2, etc.... nothing seems to be helping the bone loss. Trying to get off Prevacid, tough go. Danged if I do and danged if I don't. Anyone???????",side effect
"I have used the minivelle and developed severe hot flashes and nausea. Ive taken it off for a bit then tried again, and each time I get these symptoms. Spend the night taking off covers then putting them back on only to wake up and have to remove them again. ",side effect
"I used Vivelle Dot for years and loved it.   I had several refills left but my pharmacy called my doctor and said they no longer have it and to change my prescription to Minivelle.  I've been using it a couple of weeks and the sticky residue around the edges causes it to stick to my clothes and it gets pulled off.   Also I've had a terrible headache that I can't gat rid of, wake up  sweating, and today, even though I've never had blood pressure problems, it was quite high when checked at the doctors office.",side effect
"I was on Vivelle-dot .05 for three years and did not have a single problem. I switched to this in July based on doctor recommendation.  I started feeling nauseated and thought at first I had something, but as I continued use I had joint pain, weird head pain (and I have low blood pressure), and breast tenderness.  It started getting progressively worse and decided to start looking to see if others were having problems.  I immediately discontinued use when I read others were having problems.  I do not recommend this product.",side effect
I switched to minivelle in February just got my blood test back and estrogen way low! Hot flashes back and disrupted sleep! Going to switch back to Dot.,side effect
I have been on Vivelle Dot 0.075 for four years and i like it. It works great for me but my doctor put me on Minivelle 0.1 I DID NOT LIKE ANYTHING ABOUT IT !!!!! I had verry bad hot flashes and it made me feel sick all the time. I had a lot of side effects from Minivelle. I dont care that the price is cheaper then Vivelle Dot It is all about how it makes you feel. Went back to Vivelle Dot and my hot flashes are gone and i dont feel sick anymore !!!!!,side effect
"I am on my 4th year of taking this medication. I started it because I found out that I have  mosaic turners syndrome which threw me into early perimenopause in my early 30's. I found that I am still having irregular periods, and I had never noticed any ""menopause"" symptoms. At this point, I will keep taking as long as I believe its helping prevent O.P. I'm too young for that. PS I am a stupid smoker, and the doctor is aware. Luckily I have not had any clots, and hopefully will never get one. #At least before I quit smoking#",effectiveness
"Started it when I began having horrible hot flashes, trouble sleeping, irritability and all the usual menopausal symptoms.  I have been on it 8 years. When my dr. and I tried to take me off the HRT, about a week later the symptoms came back full force. No way I was going to suffer again so I have been on Activella(Mimvey) ever since.  My doctor has no problem with that as I feel good and it helps with bone loss.  I just turned 65 and will stay on this as long as I does not cause any problems.",side effect
"After taking this medication for only 3 weeks I've noticed getting ""very"" irritable, pain in my left calf, put on quite a bit of weight, soreness in my breasts, headaches, and the emotional roller coaster is horrible.  Needless to say, I'm OFF this medication!!!!",side effect
DO NOT LET ANY DOCTOR TALK YOU INTO A PROLIO SHOT.  IT MAKES THE PAIN WORSE.  DR. BELLAM TOLD ME IT WAS FOR POST MENAPAUSAL OSTEOARTHRITIS.  I HAD A COMPLETE HYSTERECTOMY WHEN I WAS 42.  I AM NOW 60.  THE OSTEOPOROSIS STARTED AFTER A CAR ACCIDENT.  DO NOT COUNT ON HIM TO FOLLOW UP WHEN YOU ARE IN PAIN!,effectiveness
I've gotten these injections every 6 months for 3 years with no side effects. My spine was really bad and now I've had a good report on my last bone scan. ,effectiveness
I have had 12 prolia shots.  I had my last dexascan last week.  I have had no side effects.  The T score in my spine has gone -3.0 to -1.2.  The T score in my femur has gone from -1.8 to -1.0.  I was thrilled with these results.  My physician has recommended I stop taking the prolia and just take the calcium/vitamin D supplement.  I hope it is helpful to know that some women are having some very positive results.,effectiveness
"I received my one and only injection on March 7,2019 and my life has not been the same since. I had a severe allergic reaction which affected my face and ears and neck, it enhanced my asthma to the point of 3 asthmatic reactions which I never had until this injection. I had muscle, joint and back pain to th point that I could barely walk. This is not a hoax and the person in these reviews who said it was should have her sister who is a physician read more than she has. I will say that some people do not have reactions until after multiple injections and then it is awful. I now have cardiovascular event that I never had before. This drug is poison to most post menopausal women especially if they have other health issues. It was originally formulated as a chemo drug for bone cancer, really do you think it will work for average osteoporosis without systemic damage. Think about it. The doctorâ??s have to understand what they are dispensing. I am now almost 10 months post injection and still are experiencing adverse events. The adverse events are all listed on the monogram and my doctor did not inform me of any. I will never trust again.",side effect
"I was reluctant to take this drug based on people's reviews on this site. Someone mentioned to me that it is less likely that those who have experienced no side effects consider writing reviews. I had my first injection last month and all is well. No discernible side effects. I do realize people's experiences are unique, but hopefully this review gives some balance on this site. I only gave a 3 for efficacy as that remains to be determined after my next bone scan in 3 years.",side effect
"Bone muscle aches, back pain, headaches, chills, anxiety, irregular heartbeat,  voice change, jaw pain, fatigue, irritability, can't sleep, loss of appetite, IBS blurry vision and hair loss. Have had 2 shots, 3 mos. into second. Felt great before having.",side effect
"Debilitating bone/joint/muscle pain. Headaches. Skin rashes on legs/arm/face. Extreme fatigue. Lost 2/3 of my hair and all eyelashes. All of this has led to depression, anxiety and psychotherapy. No one warned me of these side effects. 7 doctors say all is fine with me, perhaps drug-induced lupus thanks to this biological drug. ",side effect
"Terrible lower back pain. Months at physical therapy.  Developed diarrhea. Sudden for no apparent reason. Started to pay attention to what I ate. Seemed to be a connection to milk. Took a lactose intolerance test. NOT lactose intolerant yet it was always an immediate response when I ate dairy products. Went on lactose free diet. It helped but still total sensitivity to foods. Ended up in the emergency room at least 4 times for total dehydration. Had a bladder infection out of the blue. Totally weak for much of the time. Can only stand for short periods of time. Out of breath easily. I have always been a very active person. Ran a bed and breakfast and wedding business before. I did EVERYTHING! Too weak to do that now. After reading other reviews, it all begins to make sense to me now. ",side effect
"Had my first injection in February of 2019. Was sick the whole month. Thought it was due to my Hashis thyroiditis. Decided to try it again a few weeks ago in September 2019. Before I took it I was feeling pretty good with energy on the rise. Totally messed up my immune system, body aches and headaches, low energy, dizziness, irritable. Already with Hashis had a lot of these symptoms but now worse. If this is what it means to take this crap I'm not getting another one. ð??£",side effect
I have been taking this for over 3 years and have no side effects.  I only have osteoporosis in one hip now.  All other areas have improved to osteopenia or better.  I love getting one injection every 6 months instead of taking pills.,side effect
It seems that I have developed Secondary Hyperparathyroidism due to taking Prolia. It did help to improve my osteoporosis but created a whole new set of problems. I will not be having another dose. If you decide to go on Prolia please make sure you keep really good track of your calcium and PTH levels. Can’t wait until it is out of my system.,side effect
"I have been on prolia for five years. No side effects that I have noticed. Bone density went from high risk of fracture to low risk. 
",effectiveness
"I am very happy and thankful to report after 9 shots each 6 months a part - I have now moved out of osteoporosis to osteopenia!!! I am thankful to report that I have had NO side effects!          When I had been initially hesitant to start this medication, my doctor had told me he would give this to his mom or sister if they had been in my predicament - I am so happy for his encouragement.",effectiveness
" I have had 6 shots of Prolia.  After my last shot my back has become so itchy my stomach my arms  and I have no rash     This is a nightmare for me I have been to several dermatologist and no one can figure out what is going on   I had my last shot March 5, 2019 it is now almost 6 months and I still have the symptoms    Will never take this drug again can anyone please tell me how long the symptoms last   I was reading one of the side effects of Prolia and of course it said itchiness.  This truck should be taken off the market immediately ",side effect
"IÃ¢Â?Â?m sorry to see so many negative reviews. So far I have no complaints. I had severe osteoporosis after menopause. My doctor first put me on Forteo for two years. ItÃ¢Â?Â?s a daily injectable that grows new bone. I had great results! My doctor told me that in order to keep the bone that forteo grew, I needed to take Prolia every six months. He said Prolia is like the glue that keeps the bone together. Makes it thicker and stronger. This is my second year on it and the only side affect that I can think of is lower back pain. However I donÃ¢Â?Â?t know if thatÃ¢Â?Â?s from having a discectomy 10 years ago. I just had my last injection of Prolia and now my doctor said he will evaluate my bone density in six months. I will probably start a once a year  intravenous biologic drug. He said once you grow new born you need to keep taking some sort of bone medication to keep it. I am very thankful that I am a success story thus far. I donÃ¢Â?Â?t  disparage anyone elseÃ¢Â?Â?s experience but felt it was important to put a good review out there. God bless the people who had negative reviews. IÃ¢Â?Â?m sorry for your bad experiences.",effectiveness
"Wish I had never had this shot. Side effects are terrible. I’ve been sick ever since the first shot. Just like all the other ladies here. Diarrhea, body aches, weakness. It’s been 3 months and I’m getting weaker. Hope I survive this time. ",side effect
"i have had 6 injections ,  2 weeks after last injection of PROLIA i have had arm, hip, and thigh pain.  In the morning I have a difficult time getting out of bed, (pain is terrible)I have no energy I , feel i cannot catch a breath. doctor said its symptoms of PMR (polymylagia Rheu  .   ",side effect
"First injection 4 weeks ago. Constant diarrhea since then. Increase in pain 100%. Have been almost bedbound since a few days after injection.Constant fatigue, want to sleep all the time. Cannot climb a flight of stairs in my home without being terribly out of breath and needing to rest after 13 stairs. Quality of life much worse than before injection.",side effect
into my fifth month and feel worse everyday,effectiveness
Bone density has improved over two years of Prolia ,effectiveness
"I have recently had my 8th Prolia shot. So far...I have not had ANY pain or adverse effects from Prolia. Over this 4 year period, Prolia has slowly been re-building my bone density. My latest bone density scan shows my bone density is now normal throughout my body. It's amazing this drug has worked so well for me! My biggest concern is what happens if I stop taking Prolia? There are no clear answers within the medical community about what to do. I am continuing to take it until more research is available.",effectiveness
"Received my first Prolia infusion mid-October of 2018. Scheduled for second mid-April of 2019.  Went in for the shot the other day and the nurse asked if I had any jaw or dental problems. Said yes, no jaw pain but in the past 5 months my teeth have broken off at the gum line and almost completely disintegrated. The nurse said she could not give me the injection without an ok from my dentist and I asked why. She said Prolio has been known to cause tooth and jaw problems in a small percentage of patients. I have ALWAYS had good strong teeth and have taken care of them religiously! If I had known it would be so destructive to my teeth, I would never have had that Prolio infusion last October! I now look forward to very expensive dental work with dental plates or implants. Why did the original nurse not tell me of the side effects to this destructive drug?? Needless to say, I am furious at my doctor and the nursing staff for neglecting to tell me of all the side effects. There should be a class action suit against the manufacturer.     ",side effect
"This is my 3rd review of Prolia, following injection #3.  Within 3 weeks of #3, I began feeling  even more weak, fatigued and was cold all the time. I had a trip planned and seriously considered cancelling this, but went anyway.  I have never felt so terribly exhausted and weak.  When I came home, I used my husband's pulse oximeter because I was having episodes of shortness of breath. Oxygen saturation was 98%, but my heart rate was 30's and low 40's.  This continued and, I was admitted to hospital for sinus bradycardia and bigeminy and spent two days there on a heart monitor with two NORMAL trans thoracic echo cardiogram, meaning no discernible heart damage.  Was it the Prolia?  I have no proof but over-the-top suspicion.  Both the attending physician and the cardiologist told me to stop the Prolia.  They didn't really know what it was or its mechanism of action.  I have now been referred to an arrhythmia specialist.  For no apparent reason, my heart rate and rhythm are normal for awhile, then, for hours, bigeminy, trigeminy and bradycardia, even while I sleep.  They called my situation a conundrum. Of note; my serum calcium had gone from 10.8 a week before the shot, to 8.6 during hospital stay. Prolia ""may"" lower serum calcium.  I'll say!!!  (And I take D3 and Calcium religiously). Many people have good results and no side effects, but some of us simply cannot tolerate this drug. I will have Dexascan in July to determine effectiveness.  Once you start this drug, you cannot quit due to the high probability of rebound fractures. Catch-22. Evista is absolutely not an acceptable alternative to me.  Risk of blood clots, stroke and hot flashes.  Sometimes, the ""cure"" is far worse than the disease.",side effect
"Teeth became loose after first injection.  After second injection severe jaw pain.  Severe Headaches, Bone pain to the point I can barely walk for more than 5 minutes or even lift my arms to brush my teeth or comb my hair.  Extreme spine pain.  5 Kidney infections and I only have 1 kidney.  Dry skin, Ear infection and Blurred vision. Severe diarrhea.",side effect
severe pain in my knees and thigh. 3 months and not getting any better. never again,effectiveness
I'm writing this being a caregiver for my husband who is in too much pain after taking the Prolia shot. 4 days after getting the Prolia injection he woke up in unbearable pain in his thighs and shoulders. His doctor even called Prolia to see if these are normal side effects and apparently they are! Nothing he takes is relieving the pain. It wakes him out of sleep at night too about every hour. He has never had this unbearable thigh and shoulder pain before getting the Prolia injection. ,side effect
"I have had 2 shots of this poisonous drug. 1st shot in March 2018. Didn't realize that some of the effects were caused by the shot, and were not that serious.  Sept 2018, 2nd shot.  I have had almost every side effect, joint pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, swollen face, ankles, rash...you name it.  I will never take this drug again.  Mild osteo after chemo for breast cancer, so I don't believe that it was even necessary.  I'm 4 months past the 2nd shot, and I'm at least getting some of my energy back.  This med may help some people, but the reviews show that they are the minority...too many side effects. ",side effect
"Love this medication! With in 24 hours, I have great relief in all my joints. This is my second shot and am quite pleased with it. At the end of my first six months I was begging for the next dose. I was having carpal tunnel problems in both wrist, knee tightness and back muscle spasms at my T8 compression site. I had to wait an additional 2 month for my shot due to insurance changes at age 65. Got my shot yesterday and I already feel like a new woman!",effectiveness
"This drug caused insomnia and bone pain for me. Doctor insist my symptoms were not caused by Prolia. After my 3rd injection I developed severe sciatica, then severe bone pain that moved to many different parts of my body. I developed a large boney lump on my shoulder that was extremely painful. Feet and knees got so bad I couldn’t walk. I was virtually bed ridden for 3 months. Felt 90 years old. Never again. 
I refused my last shot that was due two months ago and I’m much better. This stuff literally poisoned me. Big mistake to allow this potent poison into your body",effectiveness
"I experienced severe diarrhea about a week after my first injection. It lasted on a daily basis for 6 months and one week and them disappeared.  I had several other tests to determine other possible  causes.  They were all negative.
",side effect
"This medicine should be called Prolia Poison. Side effects began with numbness/tingling in left arm and hand. Then dizziness and major spasms in the buttocks (gluteus) and pain and numbness down legs. This started in Jan, 2018 and has continued until now (Nov 27/18). The spasms and pain have been debilitating. Hopefully things will improve by Feb which will be 6 months since last injection. We were supposed to travel to Az this winter but we are reluctant to do that now. This poison has caused much turmoil in our lives. Will not take anymore injections and advise anyone reading this not to take these injections.",side effect
"This has been a horrible drug for me. I have suffered most all of the terrible side effect. Muscle and joint pain, very severe at times. I went from an active person before Prolia, now I stuggle to find strength to go each day. It is poison and should be taken off the market! ",side effect
"IMPORTANT: I was told by BCBS that this drug would be covered, but after receiving an $1,100 bill, I found out that Prolia's manufacturer would reimburse me up to $1800 per year, but ONLY if I signed away all of my personal medical history for the next 5 years to the company, which is a ridiculous invasion of privacy. I have had no bad side effects from the drug itself. It's better than Reclast, which made me fell like I had the flu, but I also haven't seen significant increase in bone density. We do need to protect our personal data and not allow pharma companies to bribe us into sharing all our data. Call their hotline and listen to their pitch. See how they try to trick you into ""pressing one to agree to all terms."" It's unreal. ",side effect
I have received two doses of Prolia.  Had a bone density scan last week.  Doctor said my bones have responded well to the injections.  I have had no side effects.  The only downside for me is that I will have to be on Prolia continually due to risk of spine fracture if I stop.,side effect
"I had three injections of Prolia and have suffered for over a year with severe jaw pain and loss of one tooth as a result of those injections.  After I had a tooth pulled, I also fought a bacterial infection for over a year.  Three dentists told me that there is a component in Prolia that attracted bacteria to the exposed bone from the extraction.  They further told me that Prolia can stay in the system for several years.  I am now going to lose one more tooth because of bone loss that is attributable to Prolia.  This medicine should not be manufactured, and I am surprised that there has not been a class action suit against the pharmaceutical company because of its terrible and costly side effects.",side effect
"I had my first injection 4 weeks ago and had I read the many reviews of Prolia, I would have not taken the drug, despite my M.D.s urging that it is a good,effective med.  I was not exactly feeling terrific a month ago, but since the shot, my entire body seems to be failing. I have constant mild to severe nausea; pains in my legs, hips, hands and spine that I've never had in my life. My skin is in constant pain/outbreak of hives and itching so bad on my entire body that it blistered in areas and peeled due to excessive scratching. Now a UTI has begun.  I had read the entire  insert material and was aware that side effects might occur but the side effects are increasing as time goes on and the fact that there is no way to purge oneself of the medication   is frightening. I feel very sick and apparently helpless.  I regret having taken this product ..even though the doctors all suggest it's ""the best medication going"" and they know of its side effects but of all their patients on the drug...know of no one who  has experienced any problem.  REALLY? ",side effect
This poison has completely destroyed my life. I went from living a active life to not being able to move. I am always in terrible pain and stay sick all the time.,effectiveness
"I got my first shot in May of 2018. In June I started to get pains in my bones, joints, jaw, feeling nausea. By August I went from a very active person to not active at all. I have so much pain I can't even walk around the block. I will not be getting another Prolia shot. I will take my chances with getting a fracture. I would like to know how long this drug stays in our system. The doctor who gave me the shot does NOT call me back after many phone calls I have sent her. This drug should be taken off the market. ",effectiveness
