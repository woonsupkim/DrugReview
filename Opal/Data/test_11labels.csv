"I am a fit 63 year old male who was surprised to learn he had low bone density. I took 4 injections of Prolia without side effects from 2014 to 2016 on recommendation of an endocrinologist. My bone density appeared to have improved slightly. I had a follow up appointment with my endocrinologist in May 2017 and he was quite concerned, having recently read reports of spontaneous spinal fractures and rapid reversal of bone density gains after ceasing to use Prolia. So we finally discussed where my Prolia use was going long term and he was vague - 10 years  of Prolia and then transition to bisphosphonates. Ten years on a drug that hadn't been tested that long! I realized I was a guinea pig taking a drug with an alarming and growing list of side effects for uncertain benefit (after all, people have fractured femurs as a result of taking this drug - one of the strongest bones in the body). Time to abandon this train before it ran off the rails or crashed. I will take no more Prolia. Before you take Prolia have a careful chat to your physician about your long term plans - once on this drug, you can't stop without rapid reversal of bone density gain - you become a slave to it - so you may want consider whether there is any point in starting?",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"I had my first injection in January.  No side effects for a while.  I have had a lot of pain between my shoulder blades and back.  I had to go to ER last w/e due to chest pains.  Not sure if it is related, will have stress test this week.  Have noticed a difference in my teeth, going to the dentist soon to see if there is a change in strength and spacing.  After reading reviews, not sure if I want to take the next shot, which is due  in June.",1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"At the age of 62, I discovered I had severe osteoporosis in the spine, and after trying oral bisphosphonates (terrible reaction!) requested denusomab. Three injections in, and helped by supplementary calcium and vitamin D, my bone density has improved by 5%. I am cautiously delighted. No noticeable side effects so far. My specialist says by age 70 at this rate my bone density will be better than that of most of my peers. ",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"About a week after first injection, developed severe neuropathy in both feet.  My doctor said that it couldn't have been from the drug.

"This month I have received my 4th injection of Prolia for having Osteoporosis. I am thankful I have had ZERO side effects! (I have previously tried  biphosphonate drugs, they  gave me terrible side effects.) I will get my bone density next June to see the results and will write a review at that time. While I am sorry for those women who have problems related to Prolia, my doctor has told me  he treats over a 100 patients and not one person has had a serious side effect.

"This drug has ruined my mother's daily life. Prior to getting this shot she was an active and fairly healthy 75 year old women.  She is miserable now, having developed skin lesions all over her body that constantly itch like crazy! She has tried everything that her doctor has told her to do. She saw a dermatologist who told her to take a bleach bath, has had steroid cream among other creams and pills to ""help"",  all of which have done nothing for this problem that arose after having this shot.  She is miserable and has lost interest in daily activities. Please read the reviews and consider the side effects even if they are rare or unlikely side effects. My mom is just waiting out the time period now for this to get out of her body so that she can be herself again.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
"Don't take this medication if you live alone.  Thank God I have a supportive husband at my side since the side effects of Prolia started kicking in 10 days after the second injection.  (By the way, the physician who talked me into taking it has quit the practice and gone into concierge medicine.)  I've gone from being a healthy 67-year-old to a partial cripple in the last 3-1/2 months.  Almost every day there's a new place that hurts.  I have widespread bone, joint and muscle pain.  Getting in and out of a car is difficult.  Yesterday, my husband had to drive me to a doctor's appointment because my knees were too stiff to work the pedals.  Having very few button-down-the front blouses is a wardrobe negative;  pulling a shirt or nightgown over my head is agony. Reaching a high shelf in the kitchen is impossible, nor can I lift a turkey for Thanksgiving.  I'm starting to use handicapped stalls in public restrooms.  All that being said, I'm still able to fast-walk five laps at the mall in the afternoons, although it hurts.  Riding in a car more than a few minutes makes me really stiff.  My collar bones hurt so much that they were x-rayed.  No bone cancer,ELMH thank God.  Next month I get to see a rheumatologist.  By the way, acupuncture didn't work for me.

"I had a Prolia injection in Feb 2016. About 8 weeks following the injection I started to experience severe UTI, bladder and systemic infections. After many rounds of antibiotics that were ineffective I ended up on mega doses of CIPPRO (1,000 mg a day for 7 days). I will never touch Prolia again. I was not adequately warned of the possible side effects. I reported my experience to Amgen, the manufacturer, and to the FDA. ",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"Further update. It is now a year since my first Prolia injection. I will be having my third injection because my bone density score has gone from -2.7 last year to -2.1 now which means I no longer have osteoporosis, it has been reduced to osteopenia.  Yes I do get aches and pains but I really cannot say that is due to the Prolia, more like general aging of my joints.  I am happy with the results. My gynecologist has said it won't improve further only stablise the condition which is still a bonus.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"This medication has ruined my life. Pain everywhere. Took shot one month ago, life has been one day after another filled with severe pain. New pain last night in hip and back area, difficulty walking. My doctor did not explain side effect possible-info after the shot. I will never take this shot again. Maker of this medication should be held accountable and doctors who prescribe this should be more informed. My doctor said ""I have never had anyone to have this reaction"".

This is my third shot, first one was not so bad, 6 months later for second shot, the severe pain started.  I put the third round for an extra few months because I didn't want to ruin my summer.  Now, after the 3rd dose I can barely move and get through the day.  I cant exercise or get to the gym, just getting out of bed and getting through my day as a teacher is almost impossible.  I WILL NEVER TAKE ANOTHER DOSE OF THIS AGAIN.  It has also done NOTHING, minimal  change in my bone density testing, so IMO do not  do it. ",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"First shot I got diarrhea about ten days later -did not connect it to the Prolia.  Next shot I got even worse diarrhea that lasted longer.

I have the worst diarrhea ever, fatigue, pain in just about every bone ",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

My family is trying to weigh the positive and negative effects of taking this medication.  I cannot understand why there are no concrete facts (i.e. bone density results) to essentially stand for the positive side of taking this medication.  Therefore there is no evidence at all that points to this medication working to improve osteoporosis.  The best review is that there were no side effects.  Where are the people who took the full doe of this medication?  That is our concern. ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
