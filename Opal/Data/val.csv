Review,Label
I suffered an atypical femur fracture from taking Prolia. Now I find out the drug co. has stated you may get vertebrae fractures if you go off it and don't start treatment again. Why is this drug on the market?The drug helped build bone but the possible side effects outweigh the advantages in my case.,side effect
"I reviewed this drug about 5 months after 1st injection - could not attribute what was happening to the Prolia, but was suspicious.  I felt as though I had aged several years, was badly fatigued, very weak and had episodes of perspiring at odd times for no apparent reason. At the time, I wouldn't have called them hot flashes; I'm 74. About 2 weeks before 2nd injection was due, I realized I was beginning to feel 'human' again.  This continued for about 2-3 weeks after injection #2, then the insidious downward spiral began again - weakness, fatigue.  This time, I realized the hot flashes had to be a result of the Prolia, complete with malodorous perspiration.  Dr. stated I would not get another test to determine benefit of this drug until I had been on it for TWO YEARS.  If I wanted to stop, she said I would need to take EVISTA, side effects = blood clots,danger of a stroke and.....hot flashes among other things.  Good grief.  If I stop the Prolia, I will be considered 'non-compliant'and there is absolutely no way I can endure hot flashes 5 months out of every 6.    One menopause experience was enough.  Feel coerced at this point.  The other side effect I am now SURE is due to this drug is chronic constipation, because function returned to my normal shortly before and after injection #2.  I am giving up my quality of life in order to spare myself another fracture.  It's a rock/hard place situation.  The cost to me is over $400/year. No matter WHAT I take, my quality of life suffers.  What a dilemma. Presently 3 months post second injection. Fatigue and weakness, not surprisingly, lead to mild depression.  It's like dominoes.",side effect
I have recently had my 7th Prolia shot. Thank God I have not had ANY adverse effects and it is helping to re-build my bones. My last bone density scan said I went back 10 years due to the success of this drug.,effectiveness
"Surgeon required me to have injection before he'd perform surgery. Expected to have 1 more. Flu like symptoms then severe pain in jaw, shoulder, wrist, fingers, hip ",side effect

"I have read and experienced almost all of the symptoms that other people have reported. Sciatica, pain in back of thighs, tired, muscle pain, flu like symptoms, many more. Had chronic pain before. Never occurred to me to reseabefore getting this shot. Had Reclast before. No side effects. If only Iâ??d known! DO not get this shot! Quality of life severely affected",side effect
"Prolia shot3/5/18 Dr. Shah Anderson and Patel

Side effects began sometime in April-May and continues today.  Arthritis pain had been managed with aspirin but increased in my hand joints to being more constant.  Using pressure on my thumbs became more painful.  The pain went into my wrist joint and right hip joint.  I started having random shooting pains in my thumbs.  I was increasingly tired even after a good night’s sleep. Depression and headaches followed.

Be using Prolia for 3 years.  Last bone density scan showed improvement. I have not experience any side effects.,effectiveness
"3RD SHOT AND THAT WILL BE MY LAST-I THOUGHT I AHD IBS NO MY RA GOT MUCH WORSE AND I HAVE ABDOMEN PAIN AND CONSTIPATION AND SEVRE LEG AND ARM PAIN AND WEAKNESS AND  I JUST WANT MY OLD LIFE BACK! THIS DRUG ""PROLIA"" MADE ME WORSE!!!",effectiveness
"Today was my 9th prolia shot, I'm doing great,Ireversed osteoporosis  by going to the gym 4 days a week, having a personal trainer doing TRX I eat very healthy organic protein foods, and taking excellent organic vitamins with stronium, I'm 55,feel like I'm 40,  I feel awesome, today was my last shot. My spine is normal,  right hip normal, left hip low end osteopenia. Stay positive and active, it's all in the mindset. Prolia is an excellent drug I'm so pleased with the results... ",effectiveness
"I gave all one stars because of the side effects. I've only had one injection, Apr 4, 2018, and on Apr 25, 2018, all of a sudden I began to have difficulty breathing. Anytime I'm up and moving around, I pant and my oxygen levels are on 80-85. I've been to my reg doctor and she gave me a breathing treatment which did not help at all, a shot of steroids, and a Z pack, none of which seemed to help. I've learned to get up slowly and to walk slowly and to take deep breaths as I do so.  I do not plan to get another injection of this stuff.  From the reviews I've read, it doesn't seem to help that much to put up with the side effects which also seems to include general weakness.  I'm the sole caregiver for my 95 yr old bedridden mother, so this has practically stopped me in my tracks!",side effect
"No obvious side effects immediately following 11-01-18 first injection.  Didn't notice anything at all.  Approximately 3 weeks after the injection, I noted some overall weakness and slight difficulty with my gait.  General malaise progressed over the winter and my strength and stamina have decreased markedly.  I do NOT know whether this was due to the Prolia or is simply a decline in my health due to aging and a really cold winter. I feel as though I've aged several years in one season! I am suspicious enough to have reported this to both the FDA and to AMGEN.  Saw PCP today for check up and she noted marked changes and suggested home physical therapy. Kind of shocking to my very independent self...not to mention scary. I have had no obvious side effects as others report. Dental check up was fine, no jaw pain, nothing obvious....just this insidious decline in overall ability to perform activities of daily living over past 5 months. I am somewhat hesitant to get a second injection. You have to take a leap of faith, I think, as positive results don't become apparent early on.  My gut is telling me to err on the side of caution....but am truly ""on the fence"" over this one.",side effect
"Great for people that can not take Fosamax, because of stomach issues.",effectiveness
"I have had 8 Prolia shots and have had no side effects.  I just received the results of my third dexascan.  I started with a T score of -3.0 in my spine.  I am now at -1.7.  My femur started at -1.8 and is now -1.0.  Needless to say I am thrilled with the results and I have had no side effects.  I am sorry that so many folks have experienced difficulties, but this drug has been very effective for me.",side effect

"About 3 weeks after my first injection of Prolia, I started experiencing back pain. I have always been a fairly active person. I eat organic foods and don't smoke or drink. Dealing with drug has resulted in it being a major feat just to cross the room. Back and hip pain, stiffening of hands, trouble with digestion, unable to sleep, in short many of the same things others have described. I've called Amgen, made a report to the FDA and let my doctor know. I have 4 more months to fight the results of this injection, and rest assured there will never be another. This drug needs to come with gigantic warning labels or taken off the market all together. ",side effect
"I am into my third month after first injection of Prolia. I have severe back pain, swollen joints in my fingers, continual bad headache/migraine. I have had one tooth filling fall out. My body gets so hot, I feel like I'm burning up. I also feel like of have the flu all the time. I feel tired all the time and depressed. I'm not going to have the next injection due in March.",side effect
After the third injection I have accelerated bone growth in mouth. My dentist is not sure if the Prolia caused this or not. I would like to know if anyone else has experienced this.,effectiveness
"Flare up of autoimmune conditions, body on fire, hand and feet pain, jaw pain  2 neurotic teeth, COPD event, walking difficult. I had these symptoms appear within 3 months of the 6 month injection. I never had these multiple problems in such a cluster. It took about 9 months to recover.",side effect
"A further update on my use of this medication.   My T score has improved again and I now have -1.5 and -1.2 scores which I am really pleased about. So, no osteoporosis only osteopenia. I have had 4 injections now and had already decided I wanted to come off this medication before I received my results. Recently I have been suffering back lower back ache and other unexplained aches and pains which are intermittent.  I do not know if this is attributed to the Prolia and unless I have a period free of it I will never know.   It has certainly worked for me and I am glad I tried it.It now remains to be seen what happens with my T scores in a year's time after only take calcium tablets and excercise. Watch this space!",effectiveness
