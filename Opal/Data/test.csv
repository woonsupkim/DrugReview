"I have had approximately 5 injections.  I have experienced everything from severe hip pain, groin pain, numbness in feet and hands, feeling of spinning, etc. had MRI, CAT scans, ultrasounds, blood work for my symptoms until I researched my medical history and discovered all my symptoms were related to the shot. Due this December for another shot and that WILL NOT HAPPEN.  THIS IS A TERRIBLE DRUG.",side effect
"Look at Mayo Clinic research on Denosaub. I had many side effects they list. Amgen did not include the same side effects for Prolia (active ingredient Denosaub). I had chest discomfort after a few weeks (we dismissed it to allergies), on the 31st day had lumps mimicking breast cancer, several rounds of biopsies, after that abscesses, dimpled skin, and more. I could feel it in my system with sweats and other changes. At around 5-months I could feel the lumps shrinking and going away. After 6-months with the exception of permanent scars, the problems have ceased. What a seriously traumatic event! I have filed FDA and Amgen reports. No one has done anything to assist. There is no data on the people who dropped out of the study after one shot. There is also no litigation pending which I would expect is the ONLY way to get vendor attention. If this happened to you or someone you know, have them file with FDA. That's the only way the next updated insert will include warnings for cancer mimicking breast issues.",side effect
"Hi,- I had my 5th injection today and still am free from adverse reactions - thank God! I also received news from my recent bone density scan that it has helped my bones become much stronger - taking me back 10 years! I did not do well on other drugs so I am thankful this one is working for me. ",effectiveness
"I am a fit 63 year old male who was surprised to learn he had low bone density. I took 4 injections of Prolia without side effects from 2014 to 2016 on recommendation of an endocrinologist. My bone density appeared to have improved slightly. I had a follow up appointment with my endocrinologist in May 2017 and he was quite concerned, having recently read reports of spontaneous spinal fractures and rapid reversal of bone density gains after ceasing to use Prolia. So we finally discussed where my Prolia use was going long term and he was vague - 10 years  of Prolia and then transition to bisphosphonates. Ten years on a drug that hadn't been tested that long! I realized I was a guinea pig taking a drug with an alarming and growing list of side effects for uncertain benefit (after all, people have fractured femurs as a result of taking this drug - one of the strongest bones in the body). Time to abandon this train before it ran off the rails or crashed. I will take no more Prolia. Before you take Prolia have a careful chat to your physician about your long term plans - once on this drug, you can't stop without rapid reversal of bone density gain - you become a slave to it - so you may want consider whether there is any point in starting?",side effect
"I had my first injection in January.  No side effects for a while.  I have had a lot of pain between my shoulder blades and back.  I had to go to ER last w/e due to chest pains.  Not sure if it is related, will have stress test this week.  Have noticed a difference in my teeth, going to the dentist soon to see if there is a change in strength and spacing.  After reading reviews, not sure if I want to take the next shot, which is due  in June.",side effect
"At the age of 62, I discovered I had severe osteoporosis in the spine, and after trying oral bisphosphonates (terrible reaction!) requested denusomab. Three injections in, and helped by supplementary calcium and vitamin D, my bone density has improved by 5%. I am cautiously delighted. No noticeable side effects so far. My specialist says by age 70 at this rate my bone density will be better than that of most of my peers. ",effectiveness
"About a week after first injection, developed severe neuropathy in both feet.  My doctor said that it couldn't have been from the drug.  Many specialists later, a vascular specialist said that the drug possibly caused my lymphedema.  It has ruined my life.  Will never get another injection.  I'd rather break a bone!",effectiveness
"5th injection, no side effects,now normal bone in hips,-1.5 in hips",side effect
"This is the worse medication my husband has ever taken. It should be taken off the market. He was in pain before but now it is 10 fold. He got his first shot back in July 2016 due for another one in Jan.2017. That is not happening. his bones hurt and he says his muscles feel like they are being pulled from the bone. Arms, legs, shoulders, neck all hurt from getting the prolia shot...  ",effectiveness
"Call FDA to report negative side effects 1 888-463-6332.  Especially if you are having stomach issues. Be sure to report if the doctor reviewed your possible side effects or did they say ""No side effects"".  Tell the FDA about your doctors reaction to your reports of Prolia side effects. Did they say this couldn't be prolia? The more we report the more likely they will review this drug.  See Ask a patient   anyone on prolia   Topix any one on prolia. You are not alone.  ",side effect
"This month I have received my 4th injection of Prolia for having Osteoporosis. I am thankful I have had ZERO side effects! (I have previously tried  biphosphonate drugs, they  gave me terrible side effects.) I will get my bone density next June to see the results and will write a review at that time. While I am sorry for those women who have problems related to Prolia, my doctor has told me  he treats over a 100 patients and not one person has had a serious side effect. ",side effect
"This drug has ruined my mother's daily life. Prior to getting this shot she was an active and fairly healthy 75 year old women.  She is miserable now, having developed skin lesions all over her body that constantly itch like crazy! She has tried everything that her doctor has told her to do. She saw a dermatologist who told her to take a bleach bath, has had steroid cream among other creams and pills to ""help"",  all of which have done nothing for this problem that arose after having this shot.  She is miserable and has lost interest in daily activities. Please read the reviews and consider the side effects even if they are rare or unlikely side effects. My mom is just waiting out the time period now for this to get out of her body so that she can be herself again.",side effect
"Don't take this medication if you live alone.  Thank God I have a supportive husband at my side since the side effects of Prolia started kicking in 10 days after the second injection.  (By the way, the physician who talked me into taking it has quit the practice and gone into concierge medicine.)  I've gone from being a healthy 67-year-old to a partial cripple in the last 3-1/2 months.  Almost every day there's a new place that hurts.  I have widespread bone, joint and muscle pain.  Getting in and out of a car is difficult.  Yesterday, my husband had to drive me to a doctor's appointment because my knees were too stiff to work the pedals.  Having very few button-down-the front blouses is a wardrobe negative;  pulling a shirt or nightgown over my head is agony. Reaching a high shelf in the kitchen is impossible, nor can I lift a turkey for Thanksgiving.  I'm starting to use handicapped stalls in public restrooms.  All that being said, I'm still able to fast-walk five laps at the mall in the afternoons, although it hurts.  Riding in a car more than a few minutes makes me really stiff.  My collar bones hurt so much that they were x-rayed.  No bone cancer,ELMH thank God.  Next month I get to see a rheumatologist.  By the way, acupuncture didn't work for me. ",side effect
"I had a Prolia injection in Feb 2016. About 8 weeks following the injection I started to experience severe UTI, bladder and systemic infections. After many rounds of antibiotics that were ineffective I ended up on mega doses of CIPPRO (1,000 mg a day for 7 days). I will never touch Prolia again. I was not adequately warned of the possible side effects. I reported my experience to Amgen, the manufacturer, and to the FDA. ",side effect
"Further update. It is now a year since my first Prolia injection. I will be having my third injection because my bone density score has gone from -2.7 last year to -2.1 now which means I no longer have osteoporosis, it has been reduced to osteopenia.  Yes I do get aches and pains but I really cannot say that is due to the Prolia, more like general aging of my joints.  I am happy with the results. My gynecologist has said it won't improve further only stablise the condition which is still a bonus.",effectiveness
"This medication has ruined my life. Pain everywhere. Took shot one month ago, life has been one day after another filled with severe pain. New pain last night in hip and back area, difficulty walking. My doctor did not explain side effect possible-info after the shot. I will never take this shot again. Maker of this medication should be held accountable and doctors who prescribe this should be more informed. My doctor said ""I have never had anyone to have this reaction"". My answer was ""You have now"". What can be done to stop this
pain and other problems? ",side effect
"Two days after receiving shot of prolia, I began to have serious joint and muscle pain. Now, 5 weeks later, the pain all over my body is so severe, I have difficulty walking and functioning at any level. I will not take this shot again.",effectiveness
"I thought I was going crazy...but reading these reviews have eased my mind.  Two weeks after my injection EVERY BONE AND JOINT in my body is extremely PAINFUL.  This is my third shot, first one was not so bad, 6 months later for second shot, the severe pain started.  I put the third round for an extra few months because I didn't want to ruin my summer.  Now, after the 3rd dose I can barely move and get through the day.  I cant exercise or get to the gym, just getting out of bed and getting through my day as a teacher is almost impossible.  I WILL NEVER TAKE ANOTHER DOSE OF THIS AGAIN.  It has also done NOTHING, minimal  change in my bone density testing, so IMO do not  do it. ",effectiveness
"First shot I got diarrhea about ten days later -did not connect it to the Prolia.  Next shot I got even worse diarrhea that lasted longer.  My GP said to take Align probiotic (and as many others as I wanted).  That helped and I have stayed on the probiotics since.  Had fourth shot six weeks ago.  I have the worst diarrhea ever, fatigue, pain in just about every bone ",side effect
"I haven taken Prolia every 6 months for 4 years.  I have minor pain in small joints of hands and feet.  Overall, my experience has been positive.  My osteopenia has not progressed.",effectiveness
"Received Prolia in March 2016 and felt fine for 3 wks. Started with numbness and tingling in face, hands and fingers. Started on one side of body and thought I was having a TIA. Then it became bilateral and did not last long-was just annoying. The numbness and tingling progressed to severe pain in right thumb which lead to severe pain, numbness, tingling, burning, cramping in right hand. Had an EMG and had mod-severe carpel tunnel. NEVER had any issue with carpel tunnel prior to injection. Had to have surgery for carpel tunnel. Now have developed carpel tunnel in left hand. Am waiting to see if symptoms subside after 6 mos from injection. I have also suffered with severe pain in every joint in my body. Take Motrin every day just to get by. Doctors are not convinced that it is Prolia related! Really??? I am very active and have hard time walking, getting out and into the car. Work full time as a nurse and feel like I am dying some days. Please use caution with this drug. I counted the months until the drug effects subside. Now at the 6 month mark and there is no let up! I just want my life back prior to Prolia!!!!",effectiveness
"First shot one month ago, few weeks developed severe hives, rash on arms, back, scalp on Prednisone and injection.  Now experiencing back pain and extremity pain, ear pain,tired. As a nurse did research and was apprehensive, talked to Dr. And he felt shot was worth it, I will never get another!",side effect
"I have had two prolia shots over the last 7 months.  There were no side effects from the first shot; however, the second shot approximately 4 weeks ago has caused tremendous muscle pain and soreness in my arms, legs and lower back.  I am wondering if this pain is permanent or will it fade with time.  If it doesn't fade, I will not be taking any more shots. ",side effect
48 hours after 1st injection developed Herpes infection which I have NOT HAD FOR 20 years! Too much of a coincidence for it not to be caused by the Prolia.  NEVER AGAIN!,side effect
"I was diagnosed with Polymyalgin Rheumatica (PMR) because I am allergic to the antibody in Prolia. PMR is a very painful auto-immune disease.  I cannot have any drug ending in ""umab.""  This happened after the first shot.",effectiveness
"I am a 1 year patient. Have experienced severe back pain, teeth chipping and overall feeling of deterioration. Will not continue, warn everyone, and hope it gets out of my system soon!",effectiveness
Had my 2nd injection of Prolia a month ago now. Usual aches and pains when I get up in the morning which I associate with my age (61).  I certainly don't think I could blame it on the drug.  Still yet to have another bone density scan (not due until November) so not sure what the effect has been yet. I am thinking positive and will report further when I have had the scan.,effectiveness
"Stiffness, all over a feeling of tightness in my head, back, abdomen and other extremities. trouble sleeping. All related to a shot of Prolia I received in April. I have MS and I do think it has exacerbated all my problems   ",effectiveness
