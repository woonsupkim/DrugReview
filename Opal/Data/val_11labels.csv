"Prolia shot3/5/18 Dr. Shah Anderson and Patel

Side effects began sometime in April-May and continues today.  Arthritis pain had been managed with aspirin but increased in my hand joints to being more constant.  Using pressure on my thumbs became more painful.  The pain went into my wrist joint and right hip joint.  I started having random shooting pains in my thumbs.  I was increasingly tired even after a good nightâ€™s sleep. Depression and headaches followed.

"I gave all one stars because of the side effects. I've only had one injection, Apr 4, 2018, and on Apr 25, 2018, all of a sudden I began to have difficulty breathing. Anytime I'm up and moving around, I pant and my oxygen levels are on 80-85. I've been to my reg doctor and she gave me a breathing treatment which did not help at all, a shot of steroids, and a Z pack, none of which seemed to help. I've learned to get up slowly and to walk slowly and to take deep breaths as I do so.  I do not plan to get another injection of this stuff.  From the reviews I've read, it doesn't seem to help that much to put up with the side effects which also seems to include general weakness.  I'm the sole caregiver for my 95 yr old bedridden mother, so this has practically stopped me in my tracks!",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
"No obvious side effects immediately following 11-01-18 first injection.  Didn't notice anything at all.  Approximately 3 weeks after the injection, I noted some overall weakness and slight difficulty with my gait.  General malaise progressed over the winter and my strength and stamina have decreased markedly.  I do NOT know whether this was due to the Prolia or is simply a decline in my health due to aging and a really cold winter. I feel as though I've aged several years in one season! I am suspicious enough to have reported this to both the FDA and to AMGEN.  Saw PCP today for check up and she noted marked changes and suggested home physical therapy. Kind of shocking to my very independent self...not to mention scary. I have had no obvious side effects as others report. Dental check up was fine, no jaw pain, nothing obvious....just this insidious decline in overall ability to perform activities of daily living over past 5 months. I am somewhat hesitant to get a second injection. You have to take a leap of faith, I think, as positive results don't become apparent early on.  My gut is telling me to err on the side of caution....but am truly ""on the fence"" over this one.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

My femur started at -1.8 and is now -1.0.  Needless to say I am thrilled with the results and I have had no side effects.

"About 3 weeks after my first injection of Prolia, I started experiencing back pain. I have always been a fairly active person. I eat organic foods and don't smoke or drink. Dealing with drug has resulted in it being a major feat just to cross the room. Back and hip pain, stiffening of hands, trouble with digestion, unable to sleep, in short many of the same things others have described. I've called Amgen, made a report to the FDA and let my doctor know. I have 4 more months to fight the results of this injection, and rest assured there will never be another. This drug needs to come with gigantic warning labels or taken off the market all together. ",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"A further update on my use of this medication.   My T score has improved again and I now have -1.5 and -1.2 scores which I am really pleased about. So, no osteoporosis only osteopenia. I have had 4 injections now and had already decided I wanted to come off this medication before I received my results. Recently I have been suffering back lower back ache and other unexplained aches and pains which are intermittent.  I do not know if this is attributed to the Prolia and unless I have a period free of it I will never know.   It has certainly worked for me and I am glad I tried it.It now remains to be seen what happens with my T scores in a year's time after only take calcium tablets and excercise.

"Look at Mayo Clinic research on Denosaub. I had many side effects they list. Amgen did not include the same side effects for Prolia (active ingredient Denosaub). I had chest discomfort after a few weeks (we dismissed it to allergies), on the 31st day had lumps mimicking breast cancer, several rounds of biopsies, after that abscesses, dimpled skin, and more. I could feel it in my system with sweats and other changes. At around 5-months I could feel the lumps shrinking and going away. After 6-months with the exception of permanent scars, the problems have ceased. What a seriously traumatic event! I have filed FDA and Amgen reports. No one has done anything to assist. There is no data on the people who dropped out of the study after one shot. There is also no litigation pending which I would expect is the ONLY way to get vendor attention. If this happened to you or someone you know, have them file with FDA. That's the only way the next updated insert will include warnings for cancer mimicking breast issues.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
