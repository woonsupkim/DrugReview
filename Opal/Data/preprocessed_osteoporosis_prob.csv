Within 3 weeks of #3, I began feeling  even more weak, fatigued and was cold all the time. I had a trip planned and seriously considered cancelling this, but went anyway.  I have never felt so terribly exhausted and weak.  When I came home, I used my husband's pulse oximeter because I was having episodes of shortness of breath. Oxygen saturation was 98%, but my heart rate was 30's and low 40's.  This continued and, I was admitted to hospital for sinus bradycardia and bigeminy and spent two days there on a heart monitor with two NORMAL trans thoracic echo cardiogram, meaning no discernible heart damage.  Was it the Prolia?  I have no proof but over-the-top suspicion.  Both the attending physician and the cardiologist told me to stop the Prolia.  They didn't really know what it was or its mechanism of action.  I have now been referred to an arrhythmia specialist.  For no apparent reason, my heart rate and rhythm are normal for awhile, then, for hours, bigeminy, trigeminy and bradycardia, even while I sleep.  They called my situation a conundrum. Of note; my serum calcium had gone from 10.8 a week before the shot, to 8.6 during hospital stay. Prolia ""may"" lower serum calcium.  I'll say!!!  (And I take D3 and Calcium religiously). Many people have good results and no side effects, but some of us simply cannot tolerate this drug. I will have Dexascan in July to determine effectiveness.

When I spoke with the mfg. Argen rep about this he said he had no other data on the side effects other than the back, hip and thigh pain. I believe these comments here say otherwise.

I have to wonder if they actually work for Amgen, considering the sheer volume of us I've found online.  Something is seriously wrong here.

One week after my shot (October 2012) I had an infection of the jawbone and it only went downhill from there.  I was sick, in and out of my doctor's office and the hospital for 6 months, but it didn't end there.  i had bone infections, pain in my thigh, lung infections, shingles, anemia and caught everything that was within 15 miles of me.  I'm pretty sure that my immune system was completely shut down and is still, eighteen months later only working at 1/4 of what it used to be.

I took this drug to prevent fractures, but it robbed me of my life for at least six months.  i do not think the cost was worth it and am pretty much convinced now that this is a scam and we are the guinea pigs.

They had to cancel the trials on multiple myeloma patients because 2x as many of them died when using Prolia.

I'm not sure why some have reactions and others don't, but I think it is highly questionable to allow these drug dealers to put this out there without having a clue.  To make it appear as though the side effects are a minimal risk when clearly they are not and to give the impression that the side effects are harmless when they are debilitating (which my OP was not) is at best disingenuous.

I've been on Prempro for years.  I'm told by several MDs that the reported side effects happen very early in the treatment, if at all.

She requested it and the infusion clinic was happy to comply. They said they normally give the first infusion over a longer time anyway.

I took Tylenol for three days to ward off any fever and to help with discomfort. The evening of the infusion I got a slight headache that lasted off and on for three days. Not terrible. I have to say that my aches and pains that I experienced were no worse than the few days after I ran my first half marathon. I was sore but rubbed a blend of 15 drops of copaiba oil mixed in 2 oz of fractionated coconut oil on the areas that were sore and got almost instant relief.

After seeing reviews, I recommended that she not do it.  Her physician explained that he had attended a conference and they have found that by administering the Reclast slowly, over 60 minutes, instead of the 15 minutes that had been used in the past, this alleviated many of the symptoms that patients have endured.  She didn’t receive any instructions from her endocrinologist, we found instructions ffrom Vanderbilt University to follow prior to a Reclast infusion (see below), which she did.  On the day of the infusion, the administering nurse told us that it would take about 15 minutes, and we told her that the doctor had given specific instructions to administer it slowly over 60 minutes.  After a call to the doctor, she gave her the Benadryl as he instructed along with Tylenol prior to the infusion.  Overall, it was actually administered between 50 – 55 minutes.  After the infusion, she said her head felt big, but really had no other issues.  After the infusion, she continued to stay hydrated and kept waiting to experience adverse effects.  I am happy to report that it has been almost 3 weeks since her infusion and she has had no ill effects from the Reclast.  I hope that this review will help someone else.

2 weeks prior to infusion and 2 weeks after infusion:
1) Increase daily Calcium to 1500 mg

Lab work at your doctor's office.

1) Hold any diuretic medications. (HCTZ, Spironolactone, water pills

Within a week he could barely walk and required a wheel chair to get into a Dr. appt.  A month later the severe pain continued, so his Dr. moved him from the 10mg Predisone that he was taking for rhuematoid arthritis to 60mg to alleviate the pain caused by Reclast.  Then a host of other issues also began from severe chills, blood pressure increased, swelling (oedema), myopathy, weakness, etc.  On 9/18 went to emergency room and was discharged despite the fact that he went in with a high heart rate and lung scan showed ""ground glass appearance"" and us telling about all the symptoms he had since the infusion.  Spent the next week going from Dr. to Dr. to no avail.  On 9/27 was admitted to hospital because of some oozing on his foot which they thought was cellulitis and not from the edema, atrial flutter, lungs still showing a problem.  Despite the fact that he had chills for over 6 weeks, so it would seem apparent that it was systemic, the hospital pumped him with antibiotics.  By 10/3 could barely breath - ARDS.  This was 6 days after admit, and hosp finally did a lung culture which was negative.  Was intubated from 10/3 until his death on 10/23 -  Cardiogenic Shock caused by Atrial Flutter, also Neurogenic Shock & Renal Failure. 

Consider the deaths for all versions of this chemical:  Reclast - 1068, Aclasta - 762, Zoledronoc Acid - 1734, Zometa - 3082, Total - 6610 deaths.

Approximately 18 hours after my infusion, I began having fever, intense nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  My physician said it was food poisoning, because, he said, vomiting and diarrhea were extremely rare with Reclast.  

By day 6 I was so weak and I had so much esophageal pain from the repeated vomiting that I went to the Emergency Department for assistance.  Tests were run to rule out a cardiac event.  I received IV fluids, along with IV zofran and a small dose of morphine for the pain.  I was discharged to my home around 12:45 AM.  At 4:00 AM I once again experienced nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  This time I was extremely weak and lost consciousness while trying to make it to the bathroom.  I returned to the Emergency Department and was admitted to the hospital.  

I am 21 days out now from the Reclast infusion, and I still have symptoms.  I am taking carafate to heal my esophagus.  I am taking lasix for swelling in my lower legs.  

The Reclast Patient Information Kit states on the back cover and 3 times inside, ""the most common side effects include flu-like symptoms, fever, muscle or joint pain, headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.""  Yet, every step of the way throughout my ordeal, some other explanation was sought for my symptoms.  Multiple tests were run.  My hospital and ER visits totaled $19,600.  

The severe nausea from Reclast was the same that I had experienced with Fosamax and Actonel.  All are bisphosphonates.  

A humorous side note:  Novartis has offered to give me my next Reclast infusion for free.

I have low vit D before the IV and still take 50,000 units each week, had/have 2 benign tumors on thyroid; already have de-generative joint disease; fibromyligia 18 out of 18 points and osteoarthritis so telling if my pain has increased is hard. I hurt all over all of the time. I only take Tylenol for headaches. I am stoic. lol  In the last 2 weeks my lower back has been really hurting and hard to stand up but I have had that before the IV. I think as one poster said 'you either have good effectiveness or bad.' It is a gamble. They want to put my sister (advanced osteoporosis) on a newer drug called Prolia. It has only been out for about 3 years. I don't know if I will have another IV or not. It would be helpful if people who have taken the IV for a longer amount of time would review it. I was also wondering about weigh gain, I have gained a lot of weight no matter what I do. So, I will try to comment after June 21, 2011.

Every single part of my body hurt, my breathing was even shallow cuz deep breaths made me hurt worse. I had no interest to eat cuz my stomach was hurting too but i forced myself to keep drinking water. I couldnt sleep at all. Life like this lasted  2 almost 3 days. Any and all calls to my doc remained unreturned. So on day 3 I found someone to drive me to ER. I was given a toridol (sp) shot which did nothing. Then given a morphine shot which after a while helped greatly.

It took 15 minutes to have the infusion, and then another 20 in the chair in case of adverse reaction.  The only side effect that evening was sluggishness, but that might be attributed to being a Friday after work.  The main two reasons I took it are: A) the only other option and I am only 51 and don't want to be hunched over by 60, and B) study results showed highly reduced incidence of fractures in people on Reclast.
I did drink a lot of Propel, and took Tylenol before and after, and ate Chex mix during treatment.  Whatever it takes.

I could not get any pain medication because pain medications have phosphates in them.  Reclast is part of the bisphosphorates group and the pain medication would have added more of this chemical into my body and prolonged my misery.

Ther pain seems to move but the worst is in the neck area upper arms, back & leg weakness. I'd like to hear from someone who has had an adverse reaction to this drug and hear if anything helped relieve their pain. I have spoken to the drug company  and have received confirmation from them and the doctor that these symptoms are definitely a reaction and has been reported by others as well.

I opted to try this.My first treatment was Friday January 8th. I began drinking water at 5am by my appt. time at 9 am I had drank 60 ounces of water and throughout the rest of the day continued. By bedtime I had about 90 - 100 ounces of water in me along with the usual 30 ounces of milk and some soda. I believe this helped because I had zero side effects (so far and it will be 48 hours soon)I continued to ""hydrate"" all day Saturday --not as much as Friday but a lot-- the Dr.s NEVER told me,in fact the words ""No prep required"" is a mistake..the infusion nurse said did they tell you to be ""well hydrated?"" uhhh--NO ..only after reading up on this on my own and asking My internist who did say ""go ahead but be hydrated"" If this is the key and ...its surly a simple one. I will have to wait until the fall 2010 to know if it helped my bones but I will know sooner if the oral treatments have been the cause of my stomach problems. If that is the case I will gladly take this treatment again.

While I am sorry for all the people who wrote comments on this site, I somehow think that if they had done their homework prior to receiving the medication and followed the instructions for proper hydration and extra calcium with vitamin D before and after the injection then possibly they wouldn't have suffered from the so-called side effects, or they would have been less severe. It is extremely important to drink lots and lots of water before and after. It's also important to take a calcium supplement with vitamin D. Vitamin D is necessary so the body can absorb the calcium. I drank tons of water before and this first week after. I also took a calcium supplement with vitamin D and am very happy to report I didn't suffer from any side effects at all. If my test results in a year show the Reclast is working for me then I will gladly take it for the rest of my life. The time it takes to go get the IV solution once a year is a small investment on my part into helping my bones become stronger. Take it from me, start doing your homework people.

Since I have other health problems, and have learned to read about side effects and things I must do first, I read about Reclast.  My rheumatologist ordered this treatment, after I told him about side effects of Fosamax and pain after falling.  He said that he like Reclast better, so he got the treatment approved.  Like I said, I did my homework, knew I needed to drink extra fluids and take at least Tylenol Arthritis for a few days; that was to keep the flu-like symptoms at bay and help the recovery.  
After the infusion, I was surprised at how good I felt.  I did take two Tylenol Arthritis at the beginning of the infusion; the nurses had recommended it.  My back did not hurt afterwards like when I took Fosamax.
I know that it has only been four days, but will monitor and be careful about how I am feeling.  I was also given a sheet at the treatment about needing to consume at least 1500mg of calcium for two weeks; I was told that it would lower my blood calcium for a short while so I bought some chewable calcium that one of the nurses recommended.

~ Although I have just recieved my 1st Infusion a few days ago and cannot say wether this drug is helping my bone loss yet, I can comment on The side effects I felt and the Anxiety I had before recieving my 1st yearly dose/infusion.

1) I was extremely worried about getting this new medication, mostly due to all the 'scary' side-effects and complications associated with this drug. My Anxiety was helped during my Infusion when the doctor went over all aspects of this medication.

2) I have had some side-effects. The day of the injection = terrible headache and eye pain (behind the eyes) last approx 24hrs. I have also had fairly severe 'bone pain' in the 2 days following the Infusion. It actually feels more like growing pains.. my pelvis/legs feel like I am in puberty again, and my spine has pain approx7/10 - Pain meds have made it managable though.

3) No other issues so far. and the eye pain was alittle scary but I was prepared so my anxiety did not turn on me. I also take Clonazepam which helped alot.

I was more scared of this drug prior to discussing it with my doctor/ just reading the ""bad stuff"" is not helpful. I am very happy now though... no more pills/fomamax every week, or other pills monthly.. I am  now looking forward to my upcoming tests (6months-8months-year) from now to see if this medication is as effective as Fosamax was for me.
I was taking Fosamax for 8 years and there was improvement in my bone density this year, so I hope my body keeps rebuilding.

The last Dr I saw was about 2 weeks ago and he prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream USP,0.1% and 2 days after I am finally seeing results. The itching is gone and the redness where the bumps had broken due to scratching is relieved and they form a scab and the scabs are dropping off,  It is such a relief! I suppose that they may have given me the other drugs previously then worked up to this drug at this time perhaps.

I did not relate the problem I was having to the drug until after I stopped taking Actonel. I developed dry eyes.  They were so bad, they would wake me up every night five or six times and I would have to put eye drops in so I could go back to sleep.  During the day, I would have to excuse myself from meetings, etc. to leave the room to put eye drops in my eyes.  I went to several eye doctors and all they could do was say I had dry eye syndrome and wanted me to start Restasis.  I had read that you have to use this forever and I was reluctant to start it.  I put up with the dry eye problem for years. My doctor took me off Actonel after the five years and after a few months, my dry eye problem completely went away!!  I was so surprised and appreciative! Even while I was on Actonel, I read the side effects and nothing was ever mentioned about dry eyes. That is the reason I am writing this review so that others may have some hope that this problem may be caused by Actonel and is reversible once the drug is stopped.

Total surprise, although I had a complete hysterectomy at age 50, and some history of osteoporosis in my family. My endocrinology N.P. put me on Forteo, a self injection a day for 2 years, as a first treatment b/c of my relatively young age, b/c I have some digestive issues, and also to try building bone first before trying to hold onto bone as Fosamax and its peers do. I gave myself the final injection last night. A bone scan last week revealed 5% improvement in my hip, which wasn't my main problem area, and a 30% improvement in my spine! I have been in a weight training program 2x a week along with a lot of walking for 2 years. The injections were simple and practically painless. I had occasional mild bruising or redness that went away quickly. Occasional mild pain in my legs may have been from the drug but who knows. There is a risk of increased calcium i the blood, but I did not experience this. I thought carefully about the statistics of risk for this drug; women who take it have a .01% change of developing a rare bone cancer. One in ten thousand. But, women of the same age who never took the drug have the exact same level of risk. Meanwhile, the risk of death within a year or two of a hip fracture is 20% for women over the age of 50. Statistically speaking, my choice to try Forteo was a no-brainer. I was able to use the Eli Lily coupon of $4 a month b/c I'm not on a government medical plan.

The news media needs to get an investigation going and people need to file lawsuits. Lawyers are taking cases other than osteonecrosis now that so many femur fractures have been reported. Only in July 2009 did Merck put a warning about femur fractures in its side-effects information and it is buried where no one could find it without a magnifying glass.

My bone density improved dramatically after just one year and I never had ANY side effects.  A few years ago I switched to Actonel monthly medications--still had no side effects.  When my insurance company increased the price of Actonel I switched to monthly Boniva and no side effects with this medication either.  I asked my dr. about all the bad reports of jaw necrosis and femur breaks and she said the studies where these side effects were noted were primarily done on older woman who had other medical issues and many had been on chemotherapy.  She said if I was healthy and had no side effects after 20 years of use, then I shouldn't worry.  I also take Citracal with Vitamin D, walk every day and am in good health and normal weight--a young 60 years of age!  My dr. has even stopped taking DEX scans annually as my bone density has improved so much. My mother had osteoporosis with a dowager's hump at 70 and shrunk 2 inches in height--she never took hormone replacement therapy drugs which contributed to the bone loss. I also have taken bio-identical hormones in the form of Tri-est compounded estrogen and that is also a contributing factor to my good bone health now I beleive.

Let's just do the life-threatening side effects: Boniva caused the esophagus to bleed, which led to a plunge in blood pressure, and CHF, congestive heart failure.

Poison Alert: This ""new"" drug should not be taken unless you have researched it and come to your own informed decision, independent of your doctor’s advice. The lovable Sally Field commercials can work on your sub-conscious making you feel you should try Boniva but beware.  Boniva (bisphophonate) could be dangerous, even fatal. This healthy woman who practiced a perfect life style, never caught up in the ""health care system"", suddenly is in a struggle for her life. One half of a Boniva pill in May 07, as a cautious approach, followed by one whole pill in June and the lights went out. If your doctor recommends any of the bisphosphonates class of drugs, Google Actonel, Fosamax or Boniva and read and study before you decide to swallow. These potentially dangerous drugs have a long half-life and accumulate in your body, increasing risk as time passes. Please warn people you love that might be frail, petite, thin-boned, sensitive to chemicals or drugs, or in poor health to avoid Boniva. In Japan Boniva is not promoted; and, it may be especially dangerous for small Asian women of slight build.  If you do take Boniva, eliminate orange juice and other acid producing foods from your diet, and do not take Advil or most of the other over the counter pain relievers, as I have read they can interact negatively with Boniva.  Being informed will help you stay healthy.

I had osteoporosis of the spine and other places on my body (synthroid was probably the culprit/trigger).  

I was ""warned"" to take those horrible medications for Osteoporosis because of the osteoporosis on my spine.  I refused to do so.  I fought osteoporosis for 2 1/2 years by taking four each (with the doctors’ permission) of the simple over-the-counter CITRACAL MAX, along with diligently eliminating caffeine and Coca Cola products (San Pellegrino was my substitution because it contains calcium). In addition, I added plenty of  yogurt and milk products to my diet.  After 2 1/2 years, to everyone's surprise, I no longer have OSTEOPOROSIS of my spine and other parts of my body (according to my DEXA Test). 

I spaced the Citracal Max tablets as follows, throughout the day: 
One tablet every 4 hours (for example, 8am, 12pm, 4pm, 8pm).  

IMPORTANT: If you are taking synthroid (thyroid medication) . . . you must make allowance in your time schedule to take the Citracal Max 4 hours ""before"" Synthroid and 4 hours ""after"" Synthroid (in order not to interfere with the strength of the Synthroid medication).  So here is an example of my time schedule (I USE MY PHONE ALARM TO HELP REMIND ME OF THE TIMES) :
6:30 AM  CITRACAL
10:30 AM ""SYNTHROID"" MEDICATION
2:30 pm  CITRACAL
6:30 PM  CITRACAL
10:30PM  CITRACAL 

DRINK A FULL GLASS OF WATER WITH EACH DOSAGE. I drank plenty of water or Pellagrino of ""decaf"" green iced tea.

you MUST discuss this with your physician(s) before attempting.  All I know is that it worked for me.

It is now almost impossible to correctly use this expensive product. I love the transdermal approach but the patches are ruined when I try to take the backing off. These patches do not work if they don't adhere evenly and the distortion of the patches due to the impossibility of taking off the backing affects the transfer of the medicine through the skin. This is a big problem. Can't believe Bayer isn't addressing this. I am an experienced patch user and I can't get these to work right. Very disappointed and there is no good alternative.

The Climara patch also relieved my dryness issues.I cannot speak to the medication's effectiveness on my bone density problems as I did not continue taking the medication long term.My insurance would not pay for this medication, and it cost me $96 for a monthly supply. Because I felt so much better, the cost was worth it to me. Side effects were the heaviness in the legs others have described...Still worth it to me. There was one side effect I could not endure, however. I am almost certain (although my doctor seemed skeptical) that the medication caused my hair to fall out. I've seen only a few other reviews that have noted this as well. About a month after stopping the medication, the hair loss stopped.
